#Serverless CMS
This is a proof of concept demo for creating a custom serverless CMS for generating static websites.

Built with:

- [AWS SDK for JavaScript in the Browser](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-browser/)
- [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) and [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
- [JSRender](https://github.com/BorisMoore/jsrender) and JSX

To get the demo up and running you will need to sign up for an AWS account and configure the Cognito, IAM and S3 services.
